# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17)

**Core value:** Agencies run every layer of a client engagement from a single white-label platform — now including closed-loop programmatic SEO that attributes dollars to pages.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — Client Profile Seeder v1 (Stage 0 prerequisite for pilot)

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 8 (Client Profile Seeder v1 — Internal Ingest + Gap Finder)
Plan: Phases 1-6 code complete. Phases 7 + 8 appended (profile seeder v1 + v2). PILOT-01 still pending, now also gated on Phase 7.
Status: M1 Phases 1-6 code complete — Phase 7 not started, Phase 8 not started, deploy + pilot remaining
Last activity: 2026-04-17 — Added Phases 7 + 8 to roadmap (11 new PROF-* requirements)

Progress: [████████░░] 75% (6 of 8 phases code complete; pilot pending)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Agency-isolation helper + ESLint rule + `kotoiq_*` migration must land before any real data handling
- Phase 1: Elementor v4 adapters built from live captured JSON (ELEM-05), not documentation
- Phase 1: `getKotoIQDb(agencyId)` helper is new-code-only (KotoIQ routes); retrofit of existing 131 routes is a separate initiative
- Phase 1: No template design exists yet — ELEM-05 schema capture will use any existing Elementor page on momentamktg.com
- Phase 2: Writes go through `Document::save()` PHP adapter — never direct `update_post_meta('_elementor_data', ...)`
- Phase 3: Pre-flight gate refuses rather than warns — construction-time defense against Google's scaled-content-abuse policy
- Phase 4: Vercel Workflow DevKit for durable publish orchestration; `koto_wp_commands` stays as plugin-call audit log
- Phase 5: IndexNow + GSC sitemap ping only — Google Indexing API excluded (restricted to JobPosting/BroadcastEvent)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. Research called out risks that are pre-mitigated in phase gates:

- Scaled-content-abuse policy → Phase 3 pre-flight gate (ADAPT-05)
- Elementor v4 atomic-widget save bugs (#32632 / #33000 / #35397) → Phase 2 `Document::save()` adapter (ELEM-04)
- Cross-agency data leak → Phase 1 foundation work (FND-01..05)
- Vercel function timeouts on bulk publish → Phase 4 Workflow orchestration (ORCH-01..05)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-17T20:15:47.603Z
Stopped at: Phase 7 context gathered
Resume file: .planning/phases/07-client-profile-seeder-v1-internal-ingest-gap-finder/07-CONTEXT.md

### Plan 1 Deliverables (COMPLETE)

- `supabase/migrations/20260505_kotoiq_builder.sql` — 10 tables + koto_wp_pages extensions + RLS policies
- `src/lib/kotoiqDb.ts` — `getKotoIQDb(agencyId)` helper with typed accessors for templates, campaigns, schema versions, builder sites

### Plan 2 Deliverables (COMPLETE)

- `eslint-rules/no-unscoped-kotoiq.mjs` — custom ESLint rule flagging unscoped kotoiq_* queries
- `eslint.config.mjs` updated to wire in the rule as `kotoiq/no-unscoped-kotoiq: error`

### Plan 3 Deliverables (COMPLETE)

- `wp-plugin/koto-builder-endpoints.php` — PHP endpoints: builder/detect, builder/pages, builder/elementor/{id} GET
- `src/app/api/wp/route.ts` — added detect_builder, list_elementor_pages, get_elementor_data proxy actions
- **Deploy note**: PHP file must be deployed to the WP plugin on momentamktg.com before endpoints work

### Plan 4 Deliverables (COMPLETE)

- `src/lib/builder/jsonPathUtils.ts` — stable ID-based deep-get/set for Elementor trees (no array indices)
- `src/lib/builder/elementorAdapter.ts` — captureSchema(), detectSlots() from live JSON
- `src/app/api/wp/route.ts` — added capture_elementor_schema action (fetches page → captures schema → persists → detects slots)

### Plan 5 Deliverables (COMPLETE — merged into Plan 4)

- `src/lib/builder/elementorAdapter.ts` — diffSchemas() classifies clean/additive/breaking drift
- capture_elementor_schema action auto-diffs against pinned schema and stores drift_status + drift_details
